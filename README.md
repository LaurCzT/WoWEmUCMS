# WoWEmUCMS
A CMS for all World of Worcraft Emulators


# About
WoWEmuCMS is a CMS made to help WoW Private server owners to manage their community. At the moment this project is in Beta (more likly Alpha stage). At the moment works only with TrinityCore - Legion (but i can easy downgrade to other version like WotlK, Cata and so on..).

# Install
I just deceid to not use Wordpress anymore and start writing this from scratch. Wordpress seems to use a lot of RAM :( and i want this project to be light :D. I started to work on design and when i will finish with design i will start codding (i didn't decieded what framework to use or write my onw.).


# To do
Lot's of things.. pff..
